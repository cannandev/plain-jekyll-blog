Hi. I‚Äôm Claire Annan, otherwise known as @cannandev on the interwebs. I‚Äôm an Atlanta-based software engineer consultant currently working at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov). It's a federal agency designed to improve the user experience of government services. Before 18F, I have about 20 years of backend and frontend development experience.

I have a lot of knowledge to share about engineering best practices. I also have advice on engineering hiring, consulting and interdisciplinary dependencies on Agile teams. I love sharing my many funny stories about freelancing and being a minority in the tech world. You can use this site as a resource.

> Claire is a great mentor. She always strives to educate and push others to excellence. She is really a gem. Thanks for everything! <cite>[Eboni Kelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eboni-kelly/), User Researcher</cite>

Content management systems are near and dear to my heart. Content managers are users too! I was a Drupal developer before 18F, so I‚Äôm comfortable working with that system. I also have no problem convincing partners why it may not be the appropriate platform for them üòè.

I‚Äôm also passionate about user research and accessibility. I love working on projects that involve prototyping and user-testing features before pushing them out to the public. I really love digging into tech that allows us to design, build, test and iterate quickly‚Ä¶so full-stack JavaScript frameworks and CSS utility-first design systems are my friends.
