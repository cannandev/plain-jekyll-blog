I recently came across an article explaining the case for describing race in alternative text attributes. This is my counter article.

## Context matters

I recently came across this article by Tolu Adegbite [^1]. In this article, they give three examples in which describing race was important. And I agree with them - for those three examples. Because each of those examples depicted race in a historical setting. The image was not decorative, but informative - it conveyed meaning to the text.

Here is an example.

## A slippery slope

Here is a comment I found regarding the article.

>This is very timely, thanks! I’m currently trying to describe two photos in alt text. One is easier - a young black girl wearing a backpack adjusting her surgical mask. Her dad is leaning down to talk to her - but most of the dad is out of frame. Should I include him?

If I'm listening to my screen reader, visiting a site to get information about COVID-19 resources near me, do I really need to know that there's an image on the page depicting a "a young black girl wearing a backpack adjusting her surgical mask with her [insert ethnicity] dad leaning down to talk to her"? How does this information get me closer to finding the resource I need on this page?

On the other hand, if this image is being added to a media library, this text would be helpful for someone looking specifically looking for a "young black girl". In this context, the description is informative. I definitely took advantage of this type of detail for my homepage image.

Here's another comment...

>...In another photo, there’s a couple sitting in airport chairs, the woman is resting her head on the man’s shoulder. The man is white, but to be honest I can’t see enough of the woman’s face to tell - she may be middle eastern, west asian, or east asian? What should I include if I can’t be thorough?

You're making a lot of assumptions there, my friend. How do you he's white? If this is an ad for an airline, does it really matter her ethnicity? Does this detailed description help me understand the context? Are they even necessary?

Probably not.

## The purpose of `alt` text

As I wrote in a [related article](), alternative text in an image should help the user understanding the content near the image. If it does not give meaning to the subject, or you find yourself coming up with an elaborate description, the image is decorative. Consider a different approach to including it in your application.

## Conclusion 

Describe race in `alt` text when race is part of the context. And please make sure it's accurate. If you have to guess, leave it out.
