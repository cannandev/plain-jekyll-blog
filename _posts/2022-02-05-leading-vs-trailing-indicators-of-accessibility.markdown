We often think automated testing tools as the answer to building accessible products. However, testing tools integrated into a CI/CD are the last resort when it comes to accessibility issues.

These tools flag issues that should have been caught during development and possibly could have been avoided with inclusive design. Once flagged, they tell a developer what to fix to pass. They are trailing indicators.

So, what are leading indicators that can get us ahead of accessibility issues? How can we design products and build them accessibly long before we deploy them? Read on for three solid examples.

## 1. Looking for a percentage of users with disabilities

In a conversation with a project manager, she expressed her surprise to learn that accessibility also included designing for neurodiverse and dyslexic users. "I'd love to know how many of ours users are in this category so we can cater to them."

Design for one, design for all.

## 2. Designing touch-dependent components

## 3. Having trouble writing image descriptions

## Relying on visual cues to indicate meaning

## Conclusion

Make accessibility part of the process instead of an afterthought. Don't rely on automated tools to catch accessibility issues.
