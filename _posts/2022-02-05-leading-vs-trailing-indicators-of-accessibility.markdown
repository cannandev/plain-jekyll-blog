We often think automated testing tools as the answer to building accessible products. However, testing tools integrated into a CI/CD are the last resort when it comes to accessibility issues.

These tools flag issues that should have been caught during development and possibly could have been avoided with inclusive design. Once flagged, they tell a developer what to fix to pass. They are trailing indicators.

So, what are leading indicators that can get us ahead of accessibility issues? How can we design products and build them accessibly long before we deploy them?

## 1. Inclusive research

## 2. Design tools and accessible prototypes

## 3. Manual testing during builds
