Hi. I’m Claire Annan, otherwise known as @cannandev on the interwebs. I’m an Atlanta-based software engineer consultant specializing in UX and accessibility. I have over 20 years backend and frontend development experience. I have a lot of knowledge to share about engineering best practices. I also have advice on engineering hiring, consulting and interdisciplinary dependencies on Agile teams. I love sharing my many funny stories about freelancing and being a minority in the tech world. I hope you use this site as a resource.

I have a strong background in software development. My top UX skills are interviewing, usability testing, wireframes, prototypes, and design systems. I love helping people. People use a lot of software. I want to make sure that everyone has a successful experience using the digital product I build. The best way to do that is through inclusive design, extensive usability testing and applying UX research methods long before writing a line of code. I help product owners understand and implement software engineering best practices that makes products accessible and scalable. Modular programming, component-driven development and manual accessibility testing are my soapboxes. I don't mind challenging the status quo to improve a user interface and keep the user's successful journey at the center of all technical decisions.
